# Firefly Logger

Firefly Field Day Logger is a web application for use 
at [ARRL Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day) operating events. 
It can also be used for [WFDA Winter Field Day](https://winterfieldday.org/).

The design of this logger is to be a simple, effective logger that 
can be used on any device that can have a reasonably modern browser
installed on it. This includes older laptops running Linux + Chromium,
tablets with Chrome or Firefox, Raspberry Pi 3, 4, or 5 with Raspian, etc.
FFDL has been tested on Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android using the
native browsers on each platform. In short, if a reasonably recent
browser can be installed, Firefly Logger will work for you.
